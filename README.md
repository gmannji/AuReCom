# Automated Risk Register Review and Compare (AuReCom)

Script is created as a tool for my monthly project risk reviews. Currently attached to a construction program where I need to manage 10 risk registers, in other words, 10 projects.

Review functions
wrong and missing input from projects
risk rating not updated
proposed actions
unapproved risks

The script will initially request for an excel file downloaded from our Risk Management System in a specific format set for our program as first input. Then it'll start to flag the risk register for risks triggering soon, risks expired and expiring soon, mitigation actions due and overdue,
