#  Changelog
#
#  2.1 user input update and better action & control cross referencing
#  2.1 added tkinter import tk to hide tk window when running the program
#  2.2 delete comment import warnings
#  2.2 update comments to be more descriptive
#  2.2 added simple instructions to user
#  2.3 added total number of active actions so that we can find the ratio of overdue and active actions
#  2.3.1 issue encountered - empty line and spaces on actions/controls will be redFilled. solution, remove them at cxreflist using .replace()
#  2.3.1 use regular expression (regex) for current controls and treatment actions for cross referencing c1,c2,c3...etc
#  2.3.1 added new list for action and current controls named valid[] for words that are valid so it wont get redfilled
#  2.3.2 added stats on active & completed actions
#  2.3.2 added exception handling for zero division error when calculating percentage of overdue actions
#  2.3.3 added a for loop for completed actions so we can append to list instead of skip # not using this #
#  2.3.3 the enumerate for loop for treatment actions taken out of its if statement and given priority to upper line of code. this is to prevent skipping if the actions are all completed and not being counted.
#  2.3.4 problem comparing risk registers when get.duplicates returned blank list. need to rectify...
#  2.3.4 added if statement checking whether changed_risks is empty. since this is a panel, it wont give a dataframe if there are no changes. so quick fix to assign an empty dataframe i.e change_new (this is empty because this is one of our panel df)
#  2.4 file_path is changed to get the file name (without extension) and added 'comments.xlsx' string to the end. this will ensure that the file saved will be in the same name.
